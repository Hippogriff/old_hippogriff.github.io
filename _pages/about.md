I am a Ph.D. student at [CICS](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) UMass-Amherst. I am
advised by Prof. [Evangelis Kalogerakis](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~kalo/), and
Prof. [Subhransu Maji](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~smaji/). I am interested in
Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Deep Reinforcement Learning. Previously, I
have worked at [VCC](https://vcc.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/Home.aspx) with Prof.
[Bernard Ghanem](http://www.bernardghanem.com/). Currently, I am working on
interpretable Generative Networks for Visual Program Induction. You can find my [CV here](/assets/CV/cv.pdf).
